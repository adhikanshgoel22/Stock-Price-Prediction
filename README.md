# 📈 Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This project uses **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural networks to predict future stock prices based on historical data. It's built using Python and TensorFlow/Keras, and trained on 5 years of daily stock data.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The goal is to build a deep learning model that can:
- Learn temporal dependencies in stock prices
- Predict future closing prices based on past trends
- Visualize actual vs. predicted prices

---

## 📁 Dataset

We will load the dataset containing stock prices over a 5-year period. The read_csv function loads the dataset into a pandas DataFrame for further analysis. 

> Sample used: `all_stocks_5yr.csv`
